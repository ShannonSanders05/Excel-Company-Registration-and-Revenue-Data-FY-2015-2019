## Project Title: Industry Performance Analysis

**Description:**

In this project, I employed Excel to conduct a comprehensive analysis of industry performance based on gross revenue for the years 2015-2019. The key steps included:

1. **Data Summation**: Utilized the SUM function to aggregate gross revenue data, providing a consolidated view for each industry across the specified timeframe.
2. **Sorting**: Employed sorting functions to arrange industry data in descending order based on gross revenue, facilitating easy identification of top-performing sectors.
3. **VLOOKUP Function**: Leveraged the VLOOKUP function to integrate additional industry-related information into the dataset, enhancing the context for a more nuanced analysis.
4. **Data Visualization**: Created visually engaging charts and graphs to represent industry performance trends over the years, offering a dynamic and insightful visualization of the data.
